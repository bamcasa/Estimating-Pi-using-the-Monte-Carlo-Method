The area of the circle is πr^2  
The area of the square is width^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2

divide the area of the circle, by the area of the square  
πr^2 / 4r^2 = π/4

The points inside the square and the points inside the circle are proportional to the area.

then you can find Pi

π ≈ 4 x (number of points inside the circle / total number of points)
